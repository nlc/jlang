A message written in English is encoded into plaintext by replacing all upper case
letters by lower case letters and then replacing each letter by its 5-bit string given
in the International Telegraph Code (see lecture notes). It is then encrypted by a
stream cipher which uses a 4-bit shift register to generate the keyword and uses
the addition table of Z_2 as its substitution table. The resulting ciphertext is given
below.
    00011 01000 11111 00110 11111 00011 10010 01001
    00011 10110 01001 00001 11010 11001 01110
(This can also be found on Moodle in the file stream.m). You discover that the
first two letters in the message are TH.
 (a) Determine the polynomial describing the shift register and find its initial state.
 (b) Draw the shift register associated with this polynomial.
 (c) Decrypt the ciphertext and determine the message.
