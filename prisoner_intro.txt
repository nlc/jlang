Where am I?
In The Village.
What do you want?
Information.
Whose side are you on?
That would be telling. We want information--information--information!
You won't get it!
By hook or by crook--we will!
Who are you?
The new Number Two.
Who is Number One?
You are Number Six.
I am not a number! I am a free man!
